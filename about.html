        <h2>About:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The books are pulled from the Google Books API.</li>
            <li>To accomodate for the union of inputs rather than taking an intersection, each input the user enters
                into the text boxes are performed as a query seperately. </li>
            <li>Another more specific query of the
                intersection of all three inputs is performed for more precise results. All of these results are then
                aggregated.</li>
            <li>In order to find matches, information about the books are hashed into specific hash maps and collisions
                are counted based on likes.</li>
            <li>Taking these properties it performs a new query and matches the user with a random book from the new
                query list.</li>
        </ul>
